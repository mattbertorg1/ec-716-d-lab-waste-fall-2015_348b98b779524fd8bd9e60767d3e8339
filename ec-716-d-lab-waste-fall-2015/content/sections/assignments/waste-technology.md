First Reflection
----------------

**Subject: Waste Management Technology**

Use this reflection to explore a waste management technology with one of three lenses:

1.  **Technologies for a specific material stream** - Choose one material and examine the technologies used to process / treat that material
2.  **Technology Case Study** - Choose three areas (cities, communities, government jurisdiction) and compare the technologies used in the three areas
3.  **Specific Technology** - Explore a technology in depth, its application, scale of use and considerations for purchase and implementation (like cost, size, etc.)

Guidelines
----------

*   4â€“5 pages; 4 pages in writing, more with charts / graphs
*   Helvetica size 12, 1.5 spacing or less

Evaluated on
------------

*   Scope of paper
*   Synthesis of material presented
*   Integration of class content

Content
-------

*   Background of technology and its application
*   Detailed analysis and synthesis of researched materials that showcases the secondary sources you used to research a technology
*   Propose an actionable outcome from research that either you (the student) or some other actor could move forward
    *   For example:
        *   What gaps need to be filled in the existing research in regards to the technology featured in your research?
        *   What are the limitations of the technology?
        *   What other innovations (system, technology, policy) could help the technology, material processing or waste management need that you researched?
